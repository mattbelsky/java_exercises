Answer the following questions:

1.) Why do we use generics?

They make applications more flexible by allowing them to perform operations on a variety of data types and objects.

2.) What is type erasure?

The generic type specified within the generic class or method is replaced when compiled.

3.) What is an example of a generic class that we have seen in the past?

ArrayList

4.) Can an interface be generic?

yes

5.) What are bound and unbound generic types?

Bound generics can only take a certain range of input types (i.e. Number), while unbound generics can take on any type.
