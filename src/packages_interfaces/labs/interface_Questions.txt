Answer the following questions:

1.) What is an interface?

It is code that exists outside the class structure and specifies methods that must be implemented by a class in order
for it to run.

2.) Why are interfaces implemented?

Implementing an interface ensures that classes will contain a specified and necessary set of instructions.

3.) What is the implement keyword used for?

It links a class to an interface. The class must then create the methods specified in the interface.

4.) How many interfaces can class implement?

any number

5.) Write a simple interface with one method.

public interface Shower {
    public void adjustWaterPressure;
}

6.) Think of a real world application where interfaces are used. Describe it's purpose.

Maybe a a mobile banking app, as one anywhere would need to authenticate a user name and password.

7.) What is wrong with the following interface?

    public interface IncorrectInterface{
        int sum(int x, int y){
            return x + y;
        }
    }

    The method should either be empty or labeled as default.
